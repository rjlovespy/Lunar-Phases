# Lunar Phases

1. The lunar phases gradually change over a synodic month (29.53 days) as the orbital positions of the Moon around Earth, and Earth around the Sun, shift. The visible side of the Moon is variously sunlit, depending on the position of the Moon in its orbit, with the sunlit portion varying from 0% (at new moon) to 100% (at full moon). 
2. Here, the eight lunar phases considering the shift in the orbital positions of the Moon around Earth are shown namely-new moon, waxing crescent, first quarter, waxing gibbous, full moon, waning gibbous, last or third quarter, waning crescent.
